        <p>“Some people may call me a crazy cat lady, but can one really have too many cats? Four kitties seems like an excellent
            starting point for a furtabulous collection.” Megan Evans</p>
        <p>I was born in Colorado and have loved being a native in this beautiful part of the country. I love the outdoors even
            though sometimes the outdoors (particularly the sun) doesn’t seem to like me. I am a connoisseur of geek culture
            and love all things Marvel movies. Due to my husband’s love of comics, I have seen every single movie that was
            based on a comic book. Road to Perdition—comic movie. Kingsmen—comic movie. Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone—a
            terrible waste of film.</p>
        <p>Studio arts was my first endeavor in life, but now coding is the next phase on the road to adulthood. Hopefully when
            I grow up, I can become a real girl, but that seems like a long way off. For now I’ll continue to live in the
            present. To see some of my artwork, check out Ducky Doodles.</p>
