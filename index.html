            I was born in Colorado and have loved being a native in this beautiful part of the country. I love the outdoors even though sometimes the outdoors (particularly the sun) doesn’t seem to like me. I am a connoisseur of geek culture and love all things Marvel movies. Due to my husband’s love of comics, I have seen every single movie that was based on a comic book. Road to Perdition—comic movie. Kingsmen—comic movie. Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone—a terrible waste of film.

            Studio arts was my first endeavor in life, but now coding is the next phase on the road t o adulthood. Hopefully when I grow up, I can become a real girl, but that seems like a long way off. For now I’ll continue to live in the present.
